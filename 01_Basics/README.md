<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
- **Data consistency and accurancy** : DBMS enforce integrity constraints to maintain the valid data means we can apply rules and regulation on database at the time of storage or maintain the relationship between two tables using primary key and foregin key constraints in table etc., if we think about RDBMS.
